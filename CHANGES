== 0.6.0 - ???
* Converted code to use FFI.
* Now requires Ruby 1.9.1 or later and Windows Vista or later.

== 0.5.2 - 14-Jul-2009
* Replaced some missing include's that I thought were unnecessary. Thanks go
  to Liu Song for the spot.
* Changed the license to Artistic 2.0, and set that explicitly in the gemspec.

== 0.5.1 - 26-Apr-2009
* Modified the Clipboard.register_format method to return the integer value
  of the registered format.
* Removed some unnecessary include's.

== 0.5.0 - 24-Apr-2009
* Added the Clipboard.notify_change method, which notifies you if any changes
  have been made to the clipboard.
* Added support for copying file lists, bitmaps and Windows metafiles.
* Added the Clipboard.clear alias for Clipboard.empty
* The previous documentation for the Clipboard.format_available? method was
  misleading. It has been corrected.
* Added rdoc for modules, classes and constants, and added some inline
  code examples for some methods.
* Gemspec update for handling a deprecated method.

== 0.4.4 - 26-Aug-2008
* Some internal refactoring to ensure that the clipboard is closed on failure
  in a more robust fashion.
* Renamed the test file.
* Eliminated the custom memcpy function, since windows-pr now does the right
  thing. This necessitated bumping the minimum required windows-pr version.

== 0.4.3 - 25-Jul-2007
* Changed ClipboardError to Clipboard::Error
* Added a Rakefile with tasks for testing and installation.
* Removed the install.rb file since installation is now handled by the Rakefile.

  Harold Hausman for the spot.

  that uses the Win32API package.
* Added a gemspec.

== 0.3.1 - 2-Feb-2006
* Unicode fix to handle characters with null bytes.  Thanks go to Brian
  Marick for the spot.

== 0.3.0 - 26-May-2005
* Changed the Clipboard.data= method to Clipboard.set_data because it does,
  in fact, take up to two arguments.  This API change is the main reason for
  the VERSION bump.
* Added Clipboard.get_data method as an alias for Clipboard.data.
* Removed the clipboard.rd file.  The Clipboard.txt file is now rdoc friendly.

* Moved the sample script to doc/examples.

== 0.1.0 - 19-Nov-2003
* Initial release
